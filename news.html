New slides online!
</h2>
<p>
Today in the post-graduate seminar at the Institute for Numerical Simulation, I gave a presentation about Gaussian process emulators for expensive simulations. I surveyed Gaussian process emulators and applications to Bayesian inverse problems. Further, I show some ideas for experimental design. Find the slides on the  <a href="media.html">media</a> page!

Yesterday I gave a presentation about Gaussian process approximations in Bayesian inverse problems. It was the first of three presentations I have to give about my MSc thesis. In this presentation I survey Gaussian processes and radial basis function interpolation, Bayesian inverse problems and Gaussian process approximations in Bayesian inverse problems.

<h2>
Spotlight: Gaussian processes and reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces
</h2>
<p>
One thing I am fascinated by is the connection between Gaussian process regression and deterministic techniques in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. For instance, the predictive mean in Gaussian process regression is nothing but the radial basis function interpolant from scattered data approximation.
There are nice surveys available, for example <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.02582" target="_blank">here</a> or <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/european-journal-of-applied-mathematics/article/interpolation-of-spatial-data-a-stochastic-or-a-deterministic-problem/D1EA0D2A6379B7737FCA054F14172E7A" target="_blank">here</a> (a pdf of the second paper can be found <a href="http://num.math.uni-goettingen.de/schaback/research/papers/IoSD.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>).

<h2>
New slides and notes online!
</h2>
<p>
From May to July I participated in a <a href="https://ins.uni-bonn.de/teachings/ss-2018-201-s5e1-graduate-seminar/" target="_blank">seminar about high-dimensional approximation and uncertainty quantification</a>. There, I gave a talk about stochastic collocation. I also typed up a summary of what I said in the talk. Find the slides and the notes on the  <a href="media.html">media</a> page!

<h2>
New slides online!
</h2>
<p>
Last week I gave a presentation about the <a href="http://h2lib.org/" target="_blank">H2Lib</a> at a post-graduate seminar at the University of Bonn. The H2Lib is an open source software library for hierarchical matrices, also known as H-matrices, and H<sup>2</sup>-matrices. In the presentation I explain how to get started on the H2Lib and show some experiments with scattered data approximation.

<h2>
Spotlight: Hierarchical matrices
</h2>
<p>
Hierarchical matrices can be used to approximate non-sparse matrices in near-linear complexity. The only requirement is that the matrix entries depend on a kernel function which exhibits a so-called <i>asymptotical smoothness</i>, like the Green kernel or the Gaussian kernel. They are very popular in boundary element methods and seem to gain popularity in finite element methods and Gaussian process techniques as well. 
I learned about hierarchical matrices at the <a href="https://www.csc.uni-kiel.de/de/veranstaltungen/wshmat2018" target="_blank">Winter School on Hierarchical Matrices</a> in Kiel last February/March; they have <a href="https://www.mis.mpg.de/de/publications/andere-reihen/ln/lecturenote-2103.html" target="_blank">lecture notes</a> available. There are also many books about hierarchical matrices, for example <a href="https://www.springer.com/de/book/9783662473238" target="_blank"> this one </a> or <a href="https://www.springer.com/de/book/9783540771463" target="_blank">this one</a>.

<h2>
Website started!
</h2>
<p>
Welcome to my website! Here, you can find some information about me, especially <a href="about.html">who I am</a> and how to <a href="contact.html">get in touch</a>. In the <a href="news.html">news</a> section, I will occasionally ramble about what I think is interesting. In the <a href="media.html">media</a> section, you can find slides of some of my presentations, among other things. Enjoy!
