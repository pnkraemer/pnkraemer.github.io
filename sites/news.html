            New preprint
        </h2>
        <p>
            We just uploaded a new preprint to bioRxiv: ``Numerical uncertainty can critically affect simulations of
            mechanistic models in neuroscience`` (see the <a href="./media.html" target=_blank>media</a> page).
            We use probabilistic numerical ODE solvers to detect how much numerical uncertainty affects ODE simulation
            of some popular neuroscience models.
            I am really excited to see probabilistic numerical ODE solvers in action!

        <h2>Seminar about ODEs and ML</h2>

        <p>
            Next term, Nathanael Bosch, Philipp Hennig, and I will organise a seminar about ``Machine Learning for and
            with Dynamical Systems``. The plan is to cover ODE inverse problems, neural ODEs, physics-informed neural
            networks, and more.
            If you're studying in T端bingen, please reach out!

        <p>
            We just uploaded a new preprint to arXiv: ``A Probabilistic State Space Model for Joint Inference from
            Differential Equations and Data`` (see the <a href="./media.html" target=_blank>media</a> page).
            We explain how latent forces in differential equation models can be inferred by merging probabilistic ODE
            solvers with Gauss--Markov process regression.
            This came out of Jonathan Schmidt's research project, what a great result!

            We explain which steps are necessary in order to compute probabilistic ODE solutions with up to 11th order
