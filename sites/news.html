        <h2> New Preprint </h2>
        <p>
            <a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.09301> Here</a> you can find a preprint of our newest paper ``Differentiable Likelihoods for Fast Inversion of 'Likelihood-Free' Dynamical Systems``. Hans Kersting, Martien Schiegg, Christian Daniel, Michael Tiemann, Philipp Hennig and I argue that inverse problems based on ordinary differential equations should not be treated as likelihood-free inference problems, among some other things.

        <h2> Seminar: 10 Minutes </h2>
        <p>
            I am happy to announce that from Nov 8 on, every Friday we will be able to bring together young ML researchers from all over Tübingen to have a joint seminar called 10 Minutes. As the name suggests, each week two of us will give a short presentation about their ongoing research. Save the date: Fridays, 2 p.m. MvL6. Hope to see you there.

Sequential Monte Carlo Methods 2019

        <p>
            This summer I will participate at the Department of Information Technology's course about sequential Monte Carlo methods which takes place August 26 - 30 at Uppsala University (<a href="http://www.it.uu.se/research/systems_and_control/education/2019/smc">link</a>).

        <p>
            I am excited to announce that in September 2019 I will start a PhD in Machine Learning at the University of Tübingen under supervision of Prof. Dr. Philipp Hennig. We will be working on automated, data-driven inference for mechanical models as part of the <i>ADIMEM</i> project; see <a href="https://fit.uni-tuebingen.de/Activity/Details?id=6097">here</a>. Stay tuned for more!

New slides and new abstract online!

        <p>
            This afternoon I gave the final presentation concluding my MSc thesis about Gaussian processes and Uncertainty quantification. In this thesis, I analyse Gaussian process emulators for Bayesian inverse problems. See the <a href="media.html#navBar">media</a> page for an abstract as well as for the slides of my presentation. Some of the python scripts I used for simulations can be found on my GitHub page: see <a href="https://github.com/pnkraemer/gp-emulators" , target=b lank>here</a>.

            Today in the post-graduate seminar at the Institute for Numerical Simulation, I gave a presentation about Gaussian process emulators for expensive simulations. I surveyed Gaussian process emulators and applications to Bayesian inverse problems. Further, I show some ideas for experimental design.

            Yesterday I gave a presentation about Gaussian process approximations in Bayesian inverse problems. It was the first of three presentations I have to give about my MSc thesis. In this presentation I survey Gaussian processes and radial basis function interpolation, Bayesian inverse problems and Gaussian process approximations in Bayesian inverse problems.

            From May to July I participated in a <a href="https://ins.uni-bonn.de/teachings/ss-2018-201-s5e1-graduate-seminar/" target="_blank">seminar about high-dimensional approximation and uncertainty quantification</a>. There, I gave a talk about stochastic collocation. I also typed up a summary of what I said in the talk. Find the slides and the notes on the <a href="media.html#navBar">media</a> page!

            Last week I gave a presentation about the <a href="http://h2lib.org/" target="_blank">H2Lib</a> at a post-graduate seminar at the University of Bonn. The H2Lib is an open source software library for hierarchical matrices, also known as H-matrices, and H<sup>2</sup>-matrices. In the presentation I explain how to get started on the H2Lib and show some experiments with scattered data approximation. Find the slides on the <a href="media.html#navBar">media</a> page!

        <p>
            Welcome to my website! Here, you can find some information about me, especially <a href="about.html#navBar">who I am</a> and how to <a href="contact.html#navBar">get in touch</a>. In the <a href="news.html#navBar">news</a> section, I will occasionally ramble about what I think is interesting. In the <a href="media.html#navBar">media</a> section, you can find slides of some of my presentations, among other things. Enjoy!
