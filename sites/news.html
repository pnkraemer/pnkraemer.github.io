            Hi! I am Nico, and a PhD student in Machine Learning at the University
            of Tübingen supervised by Prof. Dr. Philipp Hennig. 
            I am currently working on probabilistic numerics and the simulation of differential equations. 
            Prior to my PhD, I was a student research assistant at the Institute for Numerical Simulation at the University of Bonn. 
            I hold an MSc in Mathematics
            from the University of Bonn and a BSc in Mathematics in Business and Economics from the University of
            Mannheim.

            Today in the post-graduate seminar at the Institute for Numerical Simulation, I gave a presentation
            about
            Gaussian process emulators for expensive simulations. I surveyed Gaussian process emulators and
            applications
            to Bayesian inverse problems. Further, I show some ideas for experimental design. Find the slides on
            the <a href="media.html#navBar">media</a> page!

            Yesterday I gave a presentation about Gaussian process approximations in Bayesian inverse problems.
            It was
            the first of three presentations I have to give about my MSc thesis. In this presentation I survey
            Gaussian
            processes and radial basis function interpolation, Bayesian inverse problems and Gaussian process
            approximations in Bayesian inverse problems. Find the slides on the <a href="media.html#navBar">media</a>

            From May to July I participated in a <a
                href="https://ins.uni-bonn.de/teachings/ss-2018-201-s5e1-graduate-seminar/" target="_blank">seminar
                about high-dimensional approximation and uncertainty quantification</a>. There, I gave a talk
            about
            stochastic collocation. I also typed up a summary of what I said in the talk. Find the slides and

            Last week I gave a presentation about the <a href="http://h2lib.org/" target="_blank">H2Lib</a> at a
            post-graduate seminar at the University of Bonn. The H2Lib is an open source software library for
            hierarchical matrices, also known as H-matrices, and H<sup>2</sup>-matrices. In the presentation I
            explain
            how to get started on the H2Lib and show some experiments with scattered data approximation. Find
            the slides

            Welcome to my website! Here, you can find some information about me, especially <a

            In the
            <a href="news.html#navBar">news</a> section, I will occasionally ramble about what I think is
            interesting.
            In the <a href="media.html#navBar">media</a> section, you can find slides of some of my
            presentations, among
            other things. Enjoy!
