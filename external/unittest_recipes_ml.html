<!--
I use full sentences for each bullet.
Use e.g. formulations such as "Test whether", "Test if", "Assert that" and the like.
Avoid "Check", I think that reads like brainstorming.
For corner cases, use question-like formulations such as "What should the (...) be if (...)" or "How should the algorithm behave if (...)".
Use imperative for the bullets.
If there is a comment by the author to be made, use "I" and not "we"
If something needs to be clarified, do it between section header and bullets in italic.
If there is something else to mention (e.g. notation for maths), do it afterwards but still befor ethe bullets, but not in italic.
Avoid brackets.
Use external links with the target=_blank key.
Use as few words as necessary. That makes reading easier.

                <b> We have to do it. </b> Despite the popularity of software libraries like pytorch, tensorflow, numpy/scipy or scikit-learn, sometimes we cannot get around writing our own implementations of basic machine learning (ML) algorithms. To ensure that these implementations are working as expected, we write unittests.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b> It is difficult. </b> Coming up with <i> meaningful </i> unittests for algorithms involving machine learning or computational statistics is tedious in the best and extremely difficult in the worst case. To make life easier, on this website I summarise recipes for meaningful unittests for a range of ML algorithms.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b> Some vital things are ignored. </b> Albeit central to meaningful unittesting, I do not mention implementation-specific tests. For example: ''I want my parameter to be a float, hence for any other input, the algorithm must raise an exception''). Of course, this does <i>not</i> mean that they are not to be considered for unittests.

                <h2> Data sets</h2>
                <i> This section is concerned with ``debugging'' data sets, i.e. with finding anomalies in data sets which might lead to unexpected behaviour of ML algorithms. </i>
                <ul>
                    <li> Look up which data types to expect in the data set and look for anomalies. </li>
                    <li> Find and deal with missing values and NaNs. </li>
                    <li> Look for surprisingly large variances among the data within each category. Sometimes, data sets contain values like -9999 instead of a NaN. If you find a "suspicious" category, investigate further by computing summary statistics and plotting a histogram.</li>
                    <li> Sometimes it is important to identify whether the data is normalised. If it is supposed to shifted to [-1, 1], test whether min and max are within that range. If it is normalised via \(X \mapsto (X-\text{mean}(X))/\text{std(X)}\), test whether the mean is zero and the standard deviation is 1. </li>
                </ul>

Possible solutions are comparing integrals of the PDF to external implementations of the CDF or to use Metropolis-Hastings methods to generate samples. When comparing to e.g. scipy.stats' cumulative densitiy functions, be aware that scipy.stats often approximates these via quadrature which makes them inexact.</li>

                <h2> Gaussian process regression</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li> For interpolation, which uses exact data: Test that after conditioning the Gaussian process, the variance at the datapoints are exactly zero. </li>
                    <li> For regression, which uses noisy data: Test that after conditioning the Gaussian process, the variance at the datapoints are proportional to the standard deviation of the data point. </li>
                    <li> To test whether the covariance matrix is accidentally computed as \(K + sI\) instead of \(K + s^2I\): choose a small \(s\) which is large enough such that \(s^2\) is within machine precision, e.g. \(s=10^{-7}\), and test if after conditioning the process, the average deviation from the data (see bullet above) is proportional to \(s=10^{-7}\) or \(s=10^{-14}\).
                    </li>
                    <li> An alternative option to test the case that the previous bullet describes is to choose a large \(s\), e.g. 10 or 100 and investigate whether the smallest eigenvalue of \(K + sI\), respectively \(K + s^2I\) is closer to 100 or to 10000.</li>
                    <li> If error estimates for the covariance function are available---which is e.g. the case for Matern class covariances or Wendland kernels---test that the error estimate is roughly fulfulled. That is, for error rate e.g. \(h^2\), where \(h\) is the fill-distance of the pointset, test if for a pointset 4 times as large, the error is roughly a 16th of the previous error. It is unlikely to obtain an exact 16th so if you find something in between a 10th and a 22nd, the test should pass. </li>
