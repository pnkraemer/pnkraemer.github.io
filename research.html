Research
</h1>

<p>
In TÃ¼bingen, I will be working on automated, data-driven inference for mechanical models as part of the <i>ADIMEM</i> project; see <a href = "https://fit.uni-tuebingen.de/Activity/Details?id=6097">here</a>. This utilises theory from the areas of 
<ul>
<li> Inverse problems </li>
<li> Bayesian statistics </li>
<li> Probabilistic solvers for ODEs </li>
</ul>
and probabilistic numerics in general. 
</p>


<p>
At the Institute for Numerical Simulation in Bonn, I have been working on
<ul>
<li> Scattered data approximation </li>
<li> Numerical linear algebra for linear systems involving kernel matrices </li>
<li> Hierarchical matrices. </li>
</ul>
<!--My research ambitions lie somewhere between numerical analysis, computational statistics and machine learning. One of the central challenges I am intrigued by is to quantify impacts of different levels of uncertainty in complex computer models which relates to the fields of
<ul>
<li> Uncertainty quantification </li>
<li> Probabilistic numerics </li>
<li> Inverse problems. </li>
</ul>-->
</p>

<p>
Some of my research activity in the past 2 years resulted in me writing my MSc thesis at the Institute for Numerical Simulation about Gaussian processes and uncertainty quantification. Refer to the <a href="media.html#navBar">media</a> page for an abstract. Some of the python scripts I used for simulations can be found on my GitHub page: see <a href="https://github.com/pnkraemer/gp-emulators", target = blank>here</a>.

<h2>
Uncertainty Quantification
</h2>
<p>
Uncertainty quantification (UQ) concerns the propagation of uncertainty in mathematical models. It somewhat provides a connection between applied mathematics and statistics. The term however, seems to be a mathematical one; as Tony O'Hagan writes (O'Hagan, 2013):

<div class = "quote" >
``It is the AM community that is responsible for the term UQ (Uncertainty
Quantification). To a member of the Stat community, however, UQ seems a 
curiously inappropriate term because (a) it sounds as though it should cover the whole of Statistics, since one way of viewing the science of Statistics is precisely as the science of quantifying uncertainty, whereas (b) the uncertainties that are studied in the AM community do not even cover the range of uncertainties that 
statisticians would recognise in the predictions of models.''
</div>
</p>
<p>
There are many types of uncertainty propagation one could investigate. In applied mathematics, one often distinguishes (Sullivan, 2016):
<ul>
  <li> <strong> Aleatoric uncertainty:</strong> The type of uncertainty that cannot be known accurately, like the landing position of a paper plane which we throw with a certain amount of force and a certain angle; it will never land in the same position twice. </li>
  <li> <strong> Epistemic uncertainty: </strong> The type of uncertainty that we are just ``too lazy to reduce''; for example a lack of knowledge about the water temperature of a lake (we were too lazy to measure) or ignoring a current in that lake with respect to our model (it would make it highly nonlinear which we do not like)</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
What fascinates me about this topic is the combination of various mathematical disciplines one needs to understand these problems; namely probability theory, functional analysis and numerical analysis. It also exhibits many connections to probabilistic numerics, Bayesian statistics and other areas I am interested in.

<h2>
Probabilistic Numerics
</h2>
<p>
The theory of probabilistic numerical methods&mdash;short: probabilistic numerics (PN)&mdash;thinks of numerical algorithms as statistical estimators.
PN exhibits many connections to uncertainty quantification, inverse problems and general Bayesian techniques like Bayesian optimisation.
